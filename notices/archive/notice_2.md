MetaMask is beta software. 

When you log in to MetaMask, your current account is visible to every new site you visit.

For your privacy, for now, please sign out of MetaMask when you're done using a site.

Also, by default, you will be signed in to a test network. To use real Ether, you must connect to the main network manually in the top left network menu.
